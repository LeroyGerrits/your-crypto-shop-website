        <p>Your Crypto Shop is an initiative by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leroygerrits/" target="_blank">Leroy Gerrits</a>, a full-stack web developer and former business owner from the Netherlands with many years of experience building e-commerce solutions and <abbr title="Software As A Service">SAAS</abbr> platforms. Being disappointed by the scarcity of utility and real life use cases for cryptocurrencies he decided to put two and two together and create Your Crypto Shop.</p>
        <p>While there are existing means for merchants to offer their products and get paid in cryptocurrencies, most of them exist in the form of plugins/add-ons/components for third-party software, charge hefty fees, are tucked away between a myriad of other payment methods and steps in a checkout proces, are cumbersome to use and/or require at least some technical know-how to implement. With Your Crypto Shop, those thresholds are gone and merchants can fully focus on their products and sales once more.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to give merchants an intuitive toolbox to easily create a web shop to sell goods and services, and get paid in crypto.</p>
